Welcome to the Conservative and Unionist Party Election Manifesto 2019

Well actually no, they've not bothered with one yet and are probably waiting for the deadline to register your vote to pass before publishing it. Read into that what you will. 

What you need to do:

Everyone - Register to Vote - https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote

Students - Get on this site to check whether to vote in your home or away constituency - https://studentvoter.info

Check your political alignment with Vote For Policies - https://voteforpolicies.org.uk

If you think you will get better traction from your vote because of constituency history, check in at http://www.swapmyvote.uk
